# Receipes blog styled completely with tailwindcss
before now, never worked with any of these other css frameworks as i'm not a fan of css frameworks. But the concept of tailwindcss was so appealing to me when i first heard of it. So i played around with tailwindcss to see how flexible and advanced the framework is. And my first tailwindcss project is this blog, so enjoy!

## Will i be using tailwindcss from now on?
**definitely a big yes!!**
